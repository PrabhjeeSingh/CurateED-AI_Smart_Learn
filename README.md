ðŸš€ Built at Koru x Ecosystem Hackathon 2025

## Overview
This project was developed during the Koru x Ecosystem Hackathon 2025 to tackle the challenge of Enhancing Digital Learning. Our AI-powered platform helps students effectively navigate online resources while minimizing over-reliance on technology. It ensures credible research, adapts to individual learning needs, and fosters critical thinking.

## Key Features
âœ… Credible Search Results â€“ Uses Google Search API and Cohere AI to filter reliable resources.

âœ… Reading Level Adaptation â€“ Simplifies complex texts for students who need it.

âœ… AI Summaries (Teacher-Controlled) â€“ Auto-generates article overviews with optional teacher permissions.

âœ… Reflection Prompts â€“ Encourages critical thinking with AI-suggested or custom questions.

âœ… Focus Mode â€“ Helps students stay engaged by minimizing distractions.

âœ… Teacher Dashboard â€“ Tracks student progress, engagement, and Focus Mode usage.

This repository contains the implementation of a solution for Problem Area 3. The project is primarily developed using React.JS, with some HTML and CSS.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- APIs Used: Google Search API, Cohere AI

## How It Works
1. Teachers curate resources by tagging articles as Understandable and Not-Understandable.
2. Students access AI-filtered search results, ensuring only high-quality materials are available.
3. AI-generated summaries help students grasp key points (if enabled by teachers).
4. Reflection prompts are attached to Mandatory resources for deeper learning.
